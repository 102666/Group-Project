# Group-Project
Covid-19 Survivability Prediction
Our group consists of three members: Lin Yang (22058335), Muhamad Haziq Fuad (S2031779), and Yan Wu (22082478). Whether in the first or second phase of the group project, the three of us collaborated closely. Throughout the process, we faced various challenges and issues such as software installation, data processing, time conflicts, suboptimal model performance, and failed uploads in SAS Enterprise Miner, requiring us to readjust our roles. However, we worked together with determination to overcome each difficulty, successfully completing our group project.

In addition to attending classes together, we held two meetings at the He&She Caf√© to discuss our tasks. We established a WhatsApp group to facilitate work discussions and created a Teams channel for file collaboration and conducting online meetings. Each of us contributed wholeheartedly, making our group an excellent and cohesive team.
